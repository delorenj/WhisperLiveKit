## Quick Security Checks

### Before Every Commit
```bash
# Check for secrets
git diff --staged | grep -E "(api[_-]?key|secret|password|token)"

# Run security tests
cargo test --features security
npm test

# Check dependencies
cargo audit
npm audit
```

### Before Every PR
```bash
# Full security scan
./scripts/security-check.sh

# Lint for security issues
cargo clippy -- -W clippy::all
npm run lint:security

# Check for vulnerable dependencies
cargo outdated
npm outdated
```

### Weekly Checks
- Review security alerts from GitHub
- Check for new CVEs in dependencies
- Review access logs for anomalies
- Update security documentation
- Review and update this checklist
